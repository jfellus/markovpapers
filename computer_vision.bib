  abstract = {During the last decade, multimedia databases have become increasingly
	important in many application areas such as medicine, CAD, geography,
	and molecular biology. An important research issue in the field of
	multimedia databases is the content-based retrieval of similar multimedia
	objects such as images, text, and videos. However, in contrast to
	searching data in a relational database, a content-based retrieval
	requires the search of similar objects as a basic functionality of
	the database system. Most of the approaches addressing similarity
	search use a so-called feature transformation that transforms important
	properties of the multimedia objects into high-dimensional points
	(feature vectors). Thus, the similarity search is transformed into
	a search of points in the feature space that are close to a given
	query point in the high-dimensional feature space. Query processing
	in high-dimensional spaces has therefore been a very active research
	area over the last few years. A number of new index structures and
	algorithms have been proposed. It has been shown that the new index
	structures considerably improve the performance in querying large
	multimedia databases. Based on recent tutorials [Berchtold and Keim
	1998], in this survey we provide an overview of the current state
	of the art in querying multimedia databases, describing the index
	structures and algorithms for an efficient query processing in high-dimensional
	spaces. We identify the problems of processing queries in high-dimensional
	space, and we provide an overview of the proposed approaches to overcome
	these problems.},

	category (typically by automatic internet search), and we must separate
	relevant images from noise. We present a discriminative learning
	process which employs active, online learning to quickly classify
	many images with minimal user input. The principle advantage of this
	work over pre- vious endeavors is its scalability. We demonstrate
	precision which is often superior to the state-of-the-art, with scalability
	which exceeds previous work.},

	constraints have to be taken into account: search accuracy, efficiency,
	and memory usage. We first present and evaluate different ways of
	aggregating local image descriptors into a vector and show that the
	Fisher kernel achieves better performance than the reference bag-of-visual
	words approach for any given vector dimension. We then jointly optimize
	dimensionality reduction and indexing in order to obtain a precise
	vector comparison as well as a compact representation. The evaluation
	shows that the image representation can be reduced to a few dozen
	bytes while preserving high accuracy. Searching a 100 million image
	dataset takes about 250 ms on one processor core.}},

  abstract = {This thesis presents online versions of the popular bagging and boosting
	algorithms. We demonstrate theoretically and experimentally that
	the online versions perform comparably to their original batch counterparts
	in terms of classification performance. However, our online algorithms
	yield the typical practical benefits of online learning algorithms
	when the amount of training data available is large. Ensemble learning
	algorithms have become extremely popular over the last several years
	because these algorithms, which generate multiple \emph{base} models
	using traditional machine learning algorithms and combine them into
	an \emph{ensemble} model, have often demonstrated significantly better
	performance than single models. Bagging and boosting are two of the
	most popular algorithms because of their good empirical results and
	theoretical support. However, most ensemble algorithms operate in
	batch mode, i.e., they repeatedly read and process the entire training
	set. Typically, they require at least one pass through the training
	set for every base model to be included in the ensemble. The base
	model learning algorithms themselves may require several passes through
	the training set to create each base model. In situations where data
	is being generated continuously, storing data for batch learning
	is impractical, which makes using these ensemble learning algorithms
	impossible. These algorithms are also impractical in situations where
	the training set is large enough that reading and processing it many
	times would be computationally prohibitive. This thesis describes
	online versions of bagging and boosting. Unlike the batch versions,
	our online versions require only one pass through the training examples
	in order regardless of the number of base models to be combined.
	We discuss how we derive the online algorithms from their batch counterparts
	as well as theoretical and experimental evidence that our online
	algorithms perform comparably to the batch versions in terms of classification
	performance. We also demonstrate that our online algorithms have
	the practical advantage of lower running time, especially for larger
	datasets. This makes our online algorithms practical for machine
	learning and data mining tasks where the amount of training data
	available is very large.},

	unauthorized use of their content. Content-based copy detection methods
	rely on the evaluation of the similarity between potential copies

	methods practical for very large video databases. To address this
	challenge, we put forward here an optimized similarity- based search
	method that takes into account the local characteristics of the space
	of content signatures. First, refined models of the distortions undergone
	by the signatures during the copy creation process allow to search
	in a more appropriately defined area of the description space, increasing
	query selectivity and improving detection quality. Second, by identifying
	in the description space those regions where the local density of
	content signatures is high, a significant additional reduction of
	the computation cost is obtained. An evaluation on ground truth databases
	shows that the proposed solution is reliable. Scalability is then
	demonstrated on larger databases of up to 280,000 h of video.},

	compact and efficient CBIR approach suitable for broad image domains.
	It has three main components: (1) a simple and powerful image analysis
	algorithm that classifies image pixels as either border or interior,
	(2) a new logarithmic distance (dLog) for comparing histograms, and
	(3) a compact representation for the visual features extracted from
	images. Experimental results show that the BIC approach is consistently
	more compact, more efficient and more effective than state-of-the-art
	CBIR approaches based on sophisticated image analysis algorithms
	and complex distance functions. It was also observed that the dLog
	distance function has two main advantages over vectorial distances
	(e.g., L1): (1) it is able to increase substantially the effectiveness
	of (several) histogram-based CBIR approaches and, at the same time,
	(2) it reduces by 50% the space requirement to represent a histogram.},

	In Co-SVM algorithm, color and texture are naturally considered as
	sufﬁcient and uncorrelated views of an image. SVM classiﬁers are
	learned in color and texture feature subspaces, respectively. Then
	the two classiﬁers are used to classify the unlabeled data. These
	unlabeled samples which are differently classiﬁed by the two classiﬁers
	are chose to label. The experimental results show that the proposed

Its straightforward parallel formulation is well suited for distributed memory systems with reliable interconnection networks, such as massively parallel processors and clusters of workstations. However, in large-scale geographically distributed systems the straightforward parallel algorithm can be rendered useless by a single communication failure or high latency in communication paths. The lack of scalable and fault tolerant global communication and synchronisation methods in large-scale systems has hindered the adoption of the K-Means algorithm for applications in large networked systems such as wireless sensor networks, peer-to-peer systems and mobile ad hoc networks. This work proposes a fully distributed K-Means algorithm (EpidemicK-Means) which does not require global communication and is intrinsically fault tolerant. The proposed distributed K-Means algorithm provides a clustering solution which can approximate the solution of an ideal centralised algorithm over the aggregated data as closely as desired. A comparative performance analysis is carried out against the state of the art sampling methods and shows that the proposed method overcomes the limitations of the sampling-based approaches for skewed clusters distributions. The experimental analysis confirms that the proposed algorithm is very accurate and fault tolerant under unreliable network conditions (message loss and node failures) and is suitable for asynchronous networks of very large and extreme scale.}

abstract={Clustering applications cover several fields such as audio and video data compression, pattern recognition, computer vision, medical image recognition, etc. In this paper, we present a new clustering algorithm called Enhanced LBG (ELBG). It belongs to the hard and K-means vector quantization groups and derives directly from the simpler LBG. The basic idea we have developed is the concept of utility of a codeword, a powerful instrument to overcome one of the main drawbacks of clustering algorithms: generally, the results achieved are not good in the case of a bad choice of the initial codebook. We will present our experimental results showing the ELBG is able to find better codebooks than previous clustering techniques and the computational complexity is virtually the same as the simpler LBG.}
